Hospital Efficiency Dashboard
Hospital Performance Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard for monitoring hospital performance metrics, including appointment attendance, patient satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The project uses synthetically generated datasets on hospital operations.
The datasets are generated in Python using the following packages.

Faker -> generating random names and IDs
Random & Numpy -> for random selections and numbers
DateTime -> for all time manipulations
Pandas -> handling the main table structure and formats
Data Preparation
The dataset has seven Excel sheets on hospital operations. They were cleaned using Excel Power Query and Tableau Data Interpreter for analysis. The dataset was cleaned for Tableau, ensuring proper formatting for dimensions and measures. Calculated fields were created  in Tableau to derive key metrics. 

Important Metrics
•	Analyze the length of patient stay
•	Patient satisfaction score
•	Correlation between staff attendance and time taken to see patients
•	Monthly appointment trends
•	Medication error rates by staff and month-wise
•	No-shows and cancellation months
